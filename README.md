MIDI keyboard made from a toy

This project helps to convert a toy piano keyboard into a MIDI controller.

The goal of this project is to convert a toy piano from a local thrift store into a MIDI controller. 

I disassembled a toy piano and realized that the 37 button keyboard is a "matrix" of 5x8.
